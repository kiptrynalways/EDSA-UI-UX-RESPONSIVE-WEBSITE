# EDSA-UI-UX-RESPONSIVE-WEBSITE
This repo is a practice project on a modern ui/ux website in react js
this webisite is a little complex such that it has about six sections. Ecah of the sections have their separate files.
These sections can be easily navigated to from the Navigation bar menu
It is a fully responsive Website as it can be displayed and work on all devices from small screen mobile to large screen devices. 
this was made possible through the use of Media query
The Websiste has a very beautiful User Experience UX experience.
It was built from a figma design such that there is no difference from the UI/UX figma design and the display on the website.
